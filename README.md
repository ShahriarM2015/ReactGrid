# Bootstrap grid with ReactJS

ReactJS is possibly the greatest to happen to the DOM in many years & Bootstrap is possibly the best front-end framework on the web.

There is [React Bootstrap](http://react-bootstrap.github.io/) but it doesn't have the greatest part of Bootstrap - the grid.

Personally, I see Bootstraps' grid as the best grid out there. It is so diverse and allows a lot of different possibilities to the same layout at different breakpoints.

## Why?

Well we are already using ReactJS to write our HTML, so why not make the HTML we write look more specific to the component we want?

`<Row />` is a row.
`<Column />` is a column.
